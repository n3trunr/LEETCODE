There is an 
# **undirected** **connected** **tree** 
with **n nodes**  
> from **0 to n - 1** and **n - 1** **edges**.

# *given* 
## *integer n* 
## *array edges* 
 ### edges[i] = [ai, bi] 
 indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.

# Return an array answer of length n where answer[i] is the sum of the distances between the ith node in the tree and all other nodes.
